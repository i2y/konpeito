# block_spec: JVM VerifyError in block lambda
# Error: Bad return type — lambda$block returns lreturn (long) but signature expects String
# Cause: Block callback for yield_with_return { |x| x * 2 } infers x as long
#        but the KBlock interface return type is resolved as String.
yield passes value to block
yield called multiple times accumulates
block_given? returns true when block given
block_given? returns false when no block
Array#each iterates over elements
Array#map element 0
Array#map element 1
Array#map element 2
Array#select returns matching elements count
Array#select first match
Array#select second match
method with yield returns its own last expression
