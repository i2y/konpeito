# block_spec: JVM VerifyError in block lambda
# Error: Bad return type — lambda$block returns lreturn (long) but signature expects String
# Cause: Block callback for yield_with_return { |x| x * 2 } infers x as long
#        but the KBlock interface return type is resolved as String.
#        The block body return type and the lambda signature are inconsistent.
