# class_spec: JVM VerifyError in test_chained_inheritance
# Error: Bad local variable type — class C extends B but JVM cannot resolve method dispatch
# Cause: Chained inheritance (C < B < A) generates incorrect local variable types
Class.new creates an instance of the class
Class.new passes arguments to initialize
instance method returns computed value
second instance method works independently
first counter incremented twice
second counter incremented once, independent of first
class method def self.method can be called on the class
second class method works independently
instance is a Circle
instance is also a Shape via inheritance
subclass inherits methods from parent
subclass overrides parent method
super calls the parent class method
initialize uses default argument
initialize uses provided argument
first instance variable accessible via reader
second instance variable accessible via reader
custom to_s returns formatted string
method computes using instance variables
another method computes using instance variables
instance is a C
instance is a B via inheritance
instance is an A via chained inheritance
inherits nearest override from B, not A
class method works
instance method works on same class
