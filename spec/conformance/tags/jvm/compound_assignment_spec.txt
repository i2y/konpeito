# compound_assignment_spec: JVM ASM error in test_or_equals_nil
# Error: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in ASM Frame.merge
# Cause: ||= with nil/Integer mixed types causes JVM stack frame computation failure.
#        The nil branch produces Object type, Integer branch produces long (2-slot),
#        and ASM cannot merge these frame types at branch join points.
+= adds and assigns for integers
+= concatenates and assigns for strings
-= subtracts and assigns for integers
*= multiplies and assigns for integers
/= divides and assigns for integers
%= computes modulo and assigns for integers
**= raises to power and assigns for integers
||= assigns when variable is nil
||= assigns when variable is false
||= does not assign when variable is truthy
&&= does not assign when variable is nil
&&= does not assign when variable is false
&&= assigns when variable is truthy
compound assignment returns the assigned value
compound assignment updates the variable
