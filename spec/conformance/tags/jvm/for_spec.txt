# for_spec: JVM NoSuchMethodError
# Error: KArray.to_a (arity 0) — method not found on JVM KArray
# Cause: JVM backend does not implement Array#to_a which is needed by for loop desugaring
for iterates over an Array passing each element to the block
for loop variable is accessible after the loop
for iterates over an inclusive Range (1..5)
for iterates over an exclusive Range (1...5)
for returns the collection it iterated over
for returns the original collection (first element)
for with break exits the loop
for with break returns nil
for with next skips the current iteration
for with empty collection does not execute body
nested for loops iterate correctly
for executes code in the containing variable scope
for loop variable i is available after the loop
