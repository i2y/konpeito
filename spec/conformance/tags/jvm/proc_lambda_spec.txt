# proc_lambda_spec: JVM lambda closure does not see updated captured variable
# DIFF: lambda captures updated value — returns 1 (initial value) instead of 2 (updated value)
# Cause: JVM backend captures variable by value at lambda creation time, not by reference
lambda sees updated value of captured variable
