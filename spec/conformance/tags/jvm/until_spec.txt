# until_spec: JVM runtime error
# Cause: until loop not fully implemented in JVM backend
until runs while the expression is false
until optionally takes a 'do' after the expression
until executes code in containing variable scope
until returns nil if ended when condition became true
until stops running body if interrupted by break
until returns value passed to break
until returns nil if interrupted by break with no arguments
until skips to end of body with next (1+2+4+5=12)
until does not run body if the condition is already true
until with counter sums 1 to 10
until with complex two-variable condition (i)
until with complex two-variable condition (j)
nested until loops 3x4 = 12
