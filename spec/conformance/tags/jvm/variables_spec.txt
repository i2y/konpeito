# variables_spec: JVM ASM compilation error
# Error: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in ASM Frame.merge for test_local_or_assign_nil
# Cause: ||= with nil/Integer mixed types causes JVM stack frame computation failure.
#        The nil branch produces Object type, Integer branch produces long (2-slot),
#        and ASM cannot merge these frame types at branch join points.
local variable assignment and read
local variable reassignment uses latest value
local variable visible within method
+= compound assignment
-= compound assignment
*= compound assignment
||= assigns when nil
||= does not assign when already truthy
global variable assignment and read
global variable shared across methods
multiple local variables in one method
variable swap: a becomes 2
variable swap: b becomes 1
