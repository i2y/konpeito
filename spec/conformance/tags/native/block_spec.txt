# block_spec: Native backend runtime error
# Error: LocalJumpError - "no block given"
# Cause: yield/block_given? functions compiled as CRuby extension methods
#        inherit block state from the caller context. When run_tests is called
#        via `ruby -r bundle -e "run_tests"`, with_block_given sees stale block state.
# Status: runtime error (all tests blocked)
RUNTIME_ERROR: LocalJumpError - no block given
