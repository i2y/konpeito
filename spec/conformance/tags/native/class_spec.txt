# initialize argument passing crashes (wrong number of arguments)
Class.new passes args to initialize
initialize with default arg uses provided value
initialize with default arg uses default when not provided
multiple instance variables stored and read correctly
to_s on custom class returns custom string
methods using instance variables compute correctly
chained inheritance resolves to nearest override
class and instance methods coexist
