# Native: rb_proc_new creates a Proc (not lambda), so arity returns -1, lambda? returns false
# Lambda returning lambda has capture semantics issues with nested closures
DIFF lambda with no args has arity 0
DIFF lambda with one arg has arity 1
DIFF lambda with two args has arity 2
DIFF lambda#lambda? returns true
DIFF lambda returning lambda captures outer variable
DIFF lambda returning lambda reuses captured value
